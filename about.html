<p style="background-color:#9B302C; color:white; font-size:15px">The name of this city has changed with time. One of the oldest cities of India, there are several theories regarding the origin of the modern name Patna (Bengali: পাটনা; Devanagari: पटना; Kaithi: 𑂣𑂗𑂢𑂰; Gurmukhi: ਪਟਨਾ; Urdu: پٹنہ). It is etymologically derived from Patan (Devanagari: पटन), the name of the Hindu goddess, Patan Devi.[32] Patan Devi Mandir is still in old Patna near Gulzarbagh mandi along with another, Patan Devi Mandir, near Takht Sri Patna Sahib. Many believe Patna derived its name from Patli, a tree variety that was found in abundance in the historic city.[33] It is also seen on the state tourism's logo.[34] The place is mentioned in Chinese traveller Fa Hien's records as Pa-lin-fou.[32] The city has been known by various names through more than 2,000 years of existence – Pataligrama, Pataliputra, Kusumapura, Kusumdhwaja Pushpapuram, Padmavathi, Azimabad and the present-day Patna.[35][36] Legend ascribes the origin of Patna to the mythological King Putraka who created Patna by magic for his queen Patali, literally "trumpet flower", which gives it its ancient name Pataligrama. It is said that in honour of the queen's firstborn, the city was named Pataliputra. Gram is Sanskrit for village and Putra means son.[37] Legend also says that the Emerald Buddha was created in Patna (then Pataliputra) by Nagasena in 43 BCE.[38]
